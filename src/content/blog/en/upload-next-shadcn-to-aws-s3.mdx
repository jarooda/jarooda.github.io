# Pretext

Last month, I created an internal tool to help my coworkers manage image assets that will be used on the website. The features include filter, search, and upload. I developed it using *Next.js* version 14, *Shadcn/ui* as the UI framework, and *AWS S3 Bucket* as the Simple Storage Service (*S3*).

I decided to use *Shadcn* because of the simplicity of installation and usage, and the generated components can be tweaked as needed. *Shadcn* uses *Zod Schema* and *React Hook Form* for the Form component. Since this is my first time using *Shadcn*, there were some challenges because certain aspects were not documented.

Using the `aws-sdk` library was also a new experience for me because they have [announced](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/announcing-end-of-support-for-aws-sdk-for-javascript-v2/) the end-of-support (*EOS*) for *SDK Javascript V2*, which has been replaced with V3. Having been used to the old SDK, there are some differences, such as now being able to use only the packages needed for a specific service instead of the entire SDK package.

# Shadcn/ui Upload Form

In this tutorial, I will cover the file upload feature. For initializing *Next.js* and *Shadcn*, you can check [the docs](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next). First, we will create the layout. Spoiler alert, <span data-spoiler>the code will not work</span>.


```tsx
// app/page.tsx
"use client"

import { zodResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/zod"
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form"
import { z } from "zod"

import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input"
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import {
  Form,
  FormControl,
  FormField,
  FormItem,
  FormMessage
} from "@/components/ui/form"

const MAX_FILE_SIZE = 1000000 // 1MB
const ACCEPTED_IMAGE_TYPES = [
  "image/png",
  "image/jpeg",
  "image/svg+xml",
  "image/webp"
]

const formSchema = z.object({
  file: z.any().refine((file) => {
    if (!file) return false
    if (file.size > MAX_FILE_SIZE) return false
    if (!ACCEPTED_IMAGE_TYPES.includes(file.type)) return false
    return true
  })
})

export default function Home() {
  const form = useForm<z.infer<typeof formSchema>>({
    resolver: zodResolver(formSchema)
  })

  async function onSubmit(values: z.infer<typeof formSchema>) {
    console.log(values)
  }

  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24">
      <Form {...form}>
        <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
          <FormField
            control={form.control}
            name="file"
            render={({ field }) => (
              <FormField
                control={form.control}
                name="file"
                render={({ field }) => (
                  <FormItem>
                    <FormControl>
                      <Input
                        {...field}
                        type="file"
                        className=" mb-4"
                        accept="image/*"
                      />
                    </FormControl>
                    <FormMessage />
                  </FormItem>
                )}
              />
            )}
          />
          <Button className=" w-full" type="submit">
            Upload Image
          </Button>
        </form>
      </Form>
    </main>
  )
}
```

If we follow the documentation in [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/form), it will show an error:

> *Warning: A component is changing an uncontrolled input to be controlled. This is likely caused by the value changing from undefined to a defined value, which should not happen. Decide between using a controlled or uncontrolled input element for the lifetime of the component.*

This error occurs because the component initially doesn't have a value (uncontrolled), but then we assign a value from the state (controlled).

To fix this, we can modify the code to be like this.


```tsx
<!-- REST OF CODE -->

<FormField
  control={form.control}
  name="file"
  render={({ field: { value, onChange, ...fieldProps } }) => (
    <FormItem>
      <FormControl>
        <Input
          {...fieldProps}
          type="file"
          className=" mb-4"
          accept="image/*"
          onChange={(event) =>
            onChange(event.target.files && event.target.files[0])
          }
        />
      </FormControl>
      <FormMessage />
    </FormItem>
  )}
/>

<!-- REST OF CODE -->
```

By destructuring `field` and spreading `fieldProps` into the *Input* component, we can bring the props `value` and `onChange` into the *Input* component, which will then be managed by *React Hook Form*.

# AWS Config

Next, to create the upload function, we can make a helper for the *S3* client.

```ts
// lib/aws.ts

import { S3Client } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3"

// Initialize S3Client instance
const client = new S3Client({
  region: process.env.NEXT_AWS_REGION || '',
  credentials: {
    accessKeyId: process.env.NEXT_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID || '',
    secretAccessKey: process.env.NEXT_AWS_SECRET_KEY || '',
  },
})

export { client }
```

There are two ways to upload files to *AWS S3*: using *presigned URLs* (`@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner`) and using *direct upload* (`@aws-sdk/lib-storage`).

If you are confused about which one to choose, here are some differences:

**Presigned URLs**
- A Presigned URL is a link given to the user to provide temporary access to a specific S3 object.
- The link generated by the server using AWS SDK includes credentials, HTTP method, and expiration time.
- The client can use this link to directly upload files to S3 without needing authentication or storing secret keys.

The advantage of using a presigned URL is that the server does not need to handle the file upload; it only needs to generate a URL that can be used temporarily.

**Direct Upload**
- Requires AWS credentials where the function is initiated, usually done on the server.
- The client sends the file to the server, and the server uploads it to S3.

The advantage of using *direct upload* is that it can utilize other features such as *multipart upload*, *retry*, and progress tracking. Additionally, since it directly uses AWS SDK, there is no need to handle expiration or connection issues to S3.

Since we are discussing uploading a single file here, we will use the *Presigned URL* method. The flow will be as follows:

1. The client gets the file to be uploaded.
2. The client sends the required data to the server.
3. The server generates a URL to upload to S3.
4. The client uses that URL.

# Server Action

Here we will create a server action to generate a *presigned URL*.

```ts
// app/actions.ts
"use server"

import { getSignedUrl } from "@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner"
import { PutObjectCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3"
import { client } from "@/lib/aws"

export async function getAWSSignedUrl({
  fileName,
  fileType
}: {
  fileName: string
  fileType: string
}): Promise<{ status: boolean; putUrl: string }> {
  try {
    const command = new PutObjectCommand({
      Key: `uploads/${fileName}`,
      ContentType: fileType,
      Bucket: process.env.NEXT_AWS_BUCKET_NAME
    })

    // Generate pre-signed PUT URL
    const putUrl = await getSignedUrl(client, command, { expiresIn: 500 })

    return {
      status: true,
      putUrl
    }
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      status: false,
      putUrl: ""
    }
  }
}
```

By adding `expiresIn`, the URL we generate can only be accessed within that time range, enhancing the security of our application.

After that, call the `getAWSSignedUrl` function in `page.tsx`.


```ts
// page.tsx

import { getAWSSignedUrl } from "@/app/actions"

// REST OF CODE

async function onSubmit(values: z.infer<typeof formSchema>) {
  const { file } = values

  const formData = new FormData()
  formData.append("file", file)

  const { putUrl } = await getAWSSignedUrl({
    fileName: file.name,
    fileType: file.type
  })

  const response = await fetch(putUrl, {
    body: file,
    method: "PUT",
    headers: { "Content-Type": file.type }
  })

  if (!response.ok) {
    console.error("Failed to upload image")
    return
  }

  console.log("Image uploaded successfully")
}

// REST OF CODE
```

After that, run the application again. If you still encounter *CORS* issues when uploading to *S3* because the upload is from the client, you can add this rule in the *S3 Bucket Permissions*.

```json
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "*"
        ],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "PUT"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "http://localhost:3000"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": [],
        "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
    }
]
```

# Conclusion

Those are the steps to create a *file upload* feature to *AWS S3* using *Next.js* and *Shadcn*. After creating this feature, I realized that building a simple tool like *file upload* can indeed increase productivity. Developers do not need to log in to the *Simple Storage Service* just to upload files, and they can use the remaining time to work on other tasks.

The code example can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/jarooda/shadcn-upload-s3).
