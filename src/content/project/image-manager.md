An internal tool that I created for <mark>Sekolah.mu</mark> helps my teammates in the Frontend Team to <mark>upload</mark> image assets to an AWS S3 Bucket and <mark>search and filter</mark> existing images. It is built using Next.js and utilizes Supabase as the database, with simple authentication for users when they try to upload image assets.
