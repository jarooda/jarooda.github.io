# Hello! 👋

😼 Hey there! I’m **Jalu Wibowo Aji**, but you can just call me **`Jalu`**.

🧑‍💻 I’m a software engineer with over **4** years of experience building web applications. Currently, I’m part of the team at [Sekolah.mu](https://sekolah.mu) where I focus on Vue.js. My journey in tech started at [Hacktiv8 Bootcamp](https://www.hacktiv8.com/) Bootcamp, and I’m now continuing my studies for a Bachelor’s degree at [Universitas Terbuka](https://www.ut.ac.id/en/).

🤝 When I’m not coding, I like to join tech meetups in `Semarang` and connect with other developers. If you’d like to chat or collaborate, feel free to [reach me out](/#contactme).
