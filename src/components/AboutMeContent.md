# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Hey there! Iâ€™m **Jalu Wibowo Aji**, but you can just call me **`Jalu`**.

Iâ€™m a software engineer with over **4** years of experience building web applications. Currently, Iâ€™m part of the team at [Sekolah.mu](https://sekolah.mu) where I focus on Vue.js. My journey in tech started at [Hacktiv8 Bootcamp](https://www.hacktiv8.com/), and Iâ€™m now continuing my studies for a Bachelorâ€™s degree at [Universitas Terbuka](https://www.ut.ac.id/en/).

I also keep a personal list of things I enjoy such as games, films, music, anime, and figures. It helps me track what Iâ€™ve played, watched, or listened to. If youâ€™re interested, you are welcome to [take a look](/about/collections).

Hereâ€™s the gear I currently use for work, studying, and unwinding:
