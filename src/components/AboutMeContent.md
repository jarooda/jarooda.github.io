# Hey there! 👋

I’m **Jalu Wibowo Aji**, but you can just call me **`Jalu`**. I’m a frontend-focused Software Engineer who enjoys making web apps feel smooth and actually nice to use. I’ve spent the last **5+ years** building web applications, mostly using `Vue`, `Nuxt`, and `TypeScript`. These days I’m building things in the EdTech space while also taking on side projects whenever something interesting pops up.

My journey into tech kicked off at [Hacktiv8 Bootcamp](https://www.hacktiv8.com/), and I’m currently pursuing my Bachelor’s degree at [Universitas Terbuka](https://www.ut.ac.id/en/) to keep leveling up and understanding things beyond just coding. I like trying new tools, playing with UI ideas, and experimenting with frontend architecture (especially anything modular).

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me diving into [games](/collections?for=games), [movies](/collections?for=movies), [musics](/collections?for=musics), [anime](/collections?for=anime), or browsing for new [figures](/collections?for=figures) to add to my collection. Basically anything that sparks a bit of creativity or fun.

If you ever wanna build something cool or just chat about frontend stuff, feel free to [reach me out](/#contactme). I’m always open to fun projects and collaborations. You’ll probably have a chance to meet me at tech meetups around [Semarang](https://maps.app.goo.gl/D7UBcVQWcuhYKisJA).

Oh and if you're wondering, here’s the [gear](/collections?for=gadgets) I currently use for work, studying, and chilling:
