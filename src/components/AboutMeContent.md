# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m **Jalu Wibowo Aji**, but you can just call me **`Jalu`**.

Iâ€™m a Software Engineer with over **4** years of experience building web applications. Right now, Iâ€™m part of the awesome team at [Sekolah.mu](https://sekolah.mu), where I mainly work with Vue.js to craft smooth and scalable front-end experiences.

My journey into tech kicked off at [Hacktiv8 Bootcamp](https://www.hacktiv8.com/), and Iâ€™m currently pursuing my Bachelorâ€™s degree at [Universitas Terbuka](https://www.ut.ac.id/en/) to keep sharpening my skills and expanding my horizons. I like to keep learning, experimenting, and finding new ways to make stuff look and work better on the web.

When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me diving into [games](/collections?for=games), [movies](/collections?for=movies), [musics](/collections?for=musics), [anime](/collections?for=anime), or browsing for new [figures](/collections?for=figures) to add to my collection. Basically, anything that sparks a bit of creativity or fun.

Hereâ€™s the [gear](/collections?for=gadgets) I currently use for work, studying, and unwinding:
