# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m **Jalu Wibowo Aji**, but you can just call me **`Jalu`**.

Iâ€™m a software engineer with over **4** years of experience building web applications. Currently, Iâ€™m part of the team at [Sekolah.mu](https://sekolah.mu) where I focus on Vue.js. My journey in tech started at [Hacktiv8 Bootcamp](https://www.hacktiv8.com/), and Iâ€™m now continuing my studies for a Bachelorâ€™s degree at [Universitas Terbuka](https://www.ut.ac.id/en/).

I keep a personal list of things I enjoy such as [games](/collections?for=games), [movies](/collections?for=movies), [musics](/collections?for=musics), [anime](/collections?for=anime), or even [figures](/collections?for=figures) etc.


Hereâ€™s the [gear](/collections?for=gadgets) I currently use for work, studying, and unwinding:
